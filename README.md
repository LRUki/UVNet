UVNet is a Multi-VM L1 blockchain built using the Substrate framework in Rust. UVNet supports both EVM and WASM-based smart contracts and includes its unique runtime module, pallet-uvm. By leveraging pallet-uvm, UVNet allows communication between EVM and WASM-based contracts. The term UVM, or "Universal Virtual Machine," embodies the idea of providing access to multiple virtual machines.
